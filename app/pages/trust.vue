    <section>
      <h2>The short version</h2>
      <p>Discoflare is MIT-licensed software that runs in your own Cloudflare account. There is no Discoflare server between you and your workspace, no vendor database holding your messages, and no subprocessor list for your workspace data—because there is no service processing it.</p>
      <p>That leaves exactly three places where this project touches anything of yours: the guided installer on this website, an anonymous deployment heartbeat, and the source you deploy. All three are itemised below.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What the installer asks for</h2>
      <p>Connecting Cloudflare grants an OAuth token scoped to the permissions below. The token is kept in an encrypted, HTTP-only session cookie in your browser, is never written to a Discoflare database, and the session expires after one hour. Disconnecting revokes it immediately; you can also revoke it yourself from your Cloudflare account at any time.</p>
      <p>The installer requests one fixed set of scopes when you connect, including the scopes for optional features. Declining workspace email or Cloudflare Access means those scopes go unused, not unrequested.</p>
      <div v-for="group in scopeGroups" :key="group.purpose" class="scope-group">
        <h3>{{ group.purpose }}</h3>
        <p>{{ group.reason }}</p>
        <p class="scope-list">
          <code v-for="scope in group.scopes" :key="scope">{{ scope }}</code>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>The installer never asks for billing, audit log, account member management, or Zero Trust device permissions, and it cannot read Worker code or data in Cloudflare accounts you did not select.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What leaves a deployment</h2>
      <p>A guided installation records one row after it deploys, and sends an authenticated weekly heartbeat afterwards. That row is the complete set of what this project ever learns about a workspace:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Stored</th>
            <th scope="col">What it is</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr v-for="row in telemetryFields" :key="row.field">
            <td><code>{{ row.field }}</code></td>
            <td>{{ row.meaning }}</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The workspace owner can turn the heartbeat off in Settings → Telemetry. The public counters on this site are aggregates of these rows and cannot identify a deployment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What never leaves</h2>
      <p>The Cloudflare account ID, the Worker name, the workspace hostname, the domain, and the owner's name and email are not stored. Neither are messages, mail, files, database records, tasks, member lists, Agent transcripts, or any measure of how much of anything a workspace holds.</p>
      <p>Owner name, email, and password are sent to Cloudflare as encrypted Worker secrets during a first installation and are not intentionally retained by this site afterwards.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Agent boundaries</h2>
      <p>Agents are workspace members, not sign-in identities. An Agent never receives a browser session or a human login, so a member's OAuth or social sign-in grants it no repository, shell, credential, or deployment access. It cannot enter a private Channel it has not joined, every Mail action requires an explicit mailbox grant, and risky conversational commands pause until an authorized member approves them.</p>
      <p>Each Agent runs its tools in one isolated Cloudflare Containers sandbox, checkpointed to your own R2 rather than kept alive as a permanent machine. The complete boundary is documented in the <NuxtLink to="/docs/product-guide/agents">Agents guide</NuxtLink>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Compliance posture</h2>
      <p>Self-hosting moves most compliance questions from this project to you and Cloudflare. Stated plainly:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Area</th>
            <th scope="col">Status</th>
            <th scope="col">Detail</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr v-for="row in posture" :key="row.item">
            <td>{{ row.item }}</td>
            <td>{{ row.status }}</td>
            <td>{{ row.detail }}</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Subprocessors</h2>
      <p>Your workspace has none by default. It runs on the Cloudflare account you own, and enabling voice huddles adds RealtimeKit, which you configure with your own credentials.</p>
      <p>This website uses Cloudflare for hosting and for the D1 database holding the deployment rows described above, and GitHub for source, releases, and the installer manifest it downloads. Nothing on this site is shared with advertising or analytics providers, because it uses neither.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reporting a vulnerability</h2>
      <p>Report security issues privately through a <ULink :to="`${repoUrl}/security/advisories/new`" target="_blank">GitHub security advisory</ULink> on the Discoflare repository. Please include the affected version and enough detail to reproduce the issue. Do not open a public issue for a security report.</p>
